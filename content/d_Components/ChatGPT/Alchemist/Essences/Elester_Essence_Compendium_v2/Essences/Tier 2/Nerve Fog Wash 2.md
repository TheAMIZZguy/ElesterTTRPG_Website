## Description
*+1 to next attack roll*

## Application
Willing target: applies immediately (no roll-to-effect).
Unwilling target: you must successfully apply contact (GM default: touch-style attack vs **PD**, or target is Grabbed/Restrained).
Once applied: essence applies at brewed **Potency**.

## Effects by Potency
| Potency | Effects |
|---|---|
| **Potent** | +1 to next attack roll (strong). |
| **Standard** | +1 to next attack roll. |
| **Diluted** | +1 to next attack roll. (weaker; shorten duration / reduce magnitude). |

## Notes
- Effects are **fixed by Potency** (Potent/Standard/Diluted).
- If this essence is delivered but neutralized before onset/effect, it does nothing (per your antidote rules).
- Mishaps are handled by the **Alchemist Mishap rules**.
